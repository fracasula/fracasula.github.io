## Senior Software Engineer (working remotely)

I'm a Senior Software Engineer specialized in **Golang**, distributed systems and highly scalable Microservices in the Cloud.
I've also had an extensive experience with **Kubernetes**, **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases and several messaging systems 
(i.e. **Apache Kafka**, **ApachePulsar**, **VerneMQ** and **RabbitMQ**).

I worked with both Event based systems (e.g. Event Sourcing) and traditional systems. Microservices patterns like CQRS,
Event Sourcing, Orchestration/Choreography and Sagas are my bread and butter.

I'm a strong believer of Infrastructure as Code, and I'm a DevOps at heart. I also believe that CI/CD pipelines are 
really important for developers productivity and a crucial part of any serious software company pipeline.

I always strive to follow best coding practices. Good quality, speed, latency, scalability and test coverage are all
things that I strive for (and remember to test against unexpected inputs too!).
