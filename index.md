## Senior Full-Stack Engineer (working remotely)

Polyglot Full-Stack Engineer specialized in **Golang**, **Node.js**, **PHP**, **MySQL**, **Symfony 2+** and high
scalable applications in the cloud (e.g. *AWS*, *Google Cloud Platform*...).
I've also had an extensive experience with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **MongoDB**, **Apache Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**.

In the last few years I worked on event based MicroServices architectures in several different languages.

That gave me the opportunity to focus on DevOps as well as I had to configure and maintain production environments built
on top of Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform and I also had to build from scratch and maintain the entire CI/CD
pipeline (*GitLab CI*, *Docker*, *Helm*).

I always strive to follow Best Coding Practices and Test Driven Development in order to achieve the best readable and 
maintainable code possible.
